I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.),Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-,Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.,The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.,Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.,Oh, uh, that would be mine.

I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.,Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.,Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.,\"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?\",Hey, that was really good!,Okay. \"So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?\",\"Smoke away.\",I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.,Relax your hand!,Not so much!,Hey!,Alright, now try taking a puff.,Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.,It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.,Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.,Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.),Oh, Satan's minions at work again...,I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.,And this- is my reward!,Okay, so this time I won't quit!,All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.),What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.,Oh, yeah.

And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this,Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.,Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.),Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.,Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong,(deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.,(sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!,...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.,(leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!,(returns) Yeah, alright.,Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.,You got waaaay too much free time.,Happy birthday, pal!,Well, aren't we Mr. \"The glass is half empty.\",Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone,(trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh,(stops) I have no idea.,You got it.,(looking) Oh, this is not that bad.,...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes it to Joey.),We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.,Yes, Bunny,(to Joey) Could've been a peach.,What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans,(to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.,He's open!,Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!,(to the receptionist)'Scuse me.,Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.),Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!,Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please,Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women,Then what,So in your whole life, you've only been with one—(He gets a look too)—oh.,I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...,No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera),Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.,You gotta do it, man.,Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves),Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.,Alright.

All right, I'm tryin' that.,So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!,Not a one.,Oh, right, right, shut up.,No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.,Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.,Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.,Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through,It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.,Yuh-huh.,Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.

I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!,Hi, sure!,Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.,Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...,(on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!,C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!,Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.,Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!,I'm all better now.,Please, no, go, that'd be fine!,Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!,Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.,Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.),Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi!

You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can't do this!,I don't think so.,Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...,Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.)

I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.,Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.,Oh, uh, that would be mine.

I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this,Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease.

Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through,It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date.

I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.,(clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.,You guys.,I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!,That only took me an hour.,You know what the scariest part is?

Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe,Okay... okay, maybe I will...,Goodnight.,I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.),There's an image.,Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.,No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry,Does she.,Marsha, these are cave people.

No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.,I- I think they're great! I, I really do.,Aw, Mom...,Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.),(pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.,Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.,Must pee. (Goes to pee.),...How long was I in there,D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help,Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow,Mm-hmm..,Mm.,Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...,Got me.,Yeah.,Yes, yes!,Me either...
